# Chapter SLE, Section SSLE - Question C30 (pg.14)
**C30† Find all solutions to the linear system:**

x + y = 5  
2x − y = 3  

**To solve this system of equations, we will first multiply equation 1 by -2 and add to equation 2: **

x +  y = 5  
  - 3y = -7

**Now we can divide equation 2 by -3 to solve for y:**

x + y = 5
    y = 7/3
    
**Lastly, we will plug our value for y into equation 1 to solve for x: **

x + (7/3) = 15/3
x = 8/3

**Our final solution is:**
x = 8/3, y = 7/3
